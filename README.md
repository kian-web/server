Kian is a web-based roll-call system with extra features.
</div>
Main purpose of this system is to provide a simple, trusted and easy to implement way to help teachers in tasks such as roll-call and grading

## How it works?
This repo is the server of Kian system. The admin of the system could add teachers to system and they could create their own classes. Teacher adds a list of students to the class and each-one has their own unique code known as _student code_. Then teacher will share link of the class and students should use it to register their client. During the registration clients asks for student code and it should be in the class.

Then eachtime that teacher starts a session for a class, students could use their client to scan the code and save attendance. But the important point is to prevent fraud, nobody can register their client during the session.

## Who/What is "Kian"?
Kian Pirfalak is a 9 years old boy whom were murdurred by government counterinsurgency forces in 2022/1401 during the Mahsa Amini protests. The old version of this system was developing during this events and I choosen this name to commemorate the memory of this innocent boy and everybody we lost during this events. Also the logo idea (Rainbow) and the phrase "In the name of God of the rainbow" are related to him.
